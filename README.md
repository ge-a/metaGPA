## Overview
**MetaGPA (Metagenomics -GenomePhenome Association)** pipeline is used to link genetic information (e.g. genes encoding for enzymes) in metagenome with a dedicated functional phenotype (e.g. DNA cytosine modification).
The main MetaGPA pipeline identifies protein family domains (Pfam, from Pfam-A database, http://pfam.xfam.org/) which are significantly associated with the studied phenotype.
We also provide additional scripts for further analyses of any chosen interested Pfam identified from the main pipeline.
For more details, please refer to our paper: [A Genome-Phenome Association study in native microbiomes identifies a mechanism for cytosine modification in DNA and RNA.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/70021)
